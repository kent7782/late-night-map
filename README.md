# late-night-map
A simple use of Google Maps and Places API to search shops that are open at night. It can still be used during the day, but it's essential useless.

Double-click to drop a pin and enter a keyword for searching places near the pin, and click on the yellow markers to show more info.

This map does not improve Google Maps in any way, except that the "Open now" option is always on and it feels like it's at night.

Please feel free to use it to explore more places and activities during the night and do whatever you want with it.
